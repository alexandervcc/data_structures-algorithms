Binary Search Tree
-Allow: insertion, deelton, retriaval in O(logn)
-left: smaller than parent
-right: greater parent

ADVANCED:
-AVL Trees
-Red-Black Trees

TRAVERSAL:
-Level: visit nodes on each level
-Pre:   visit root of every subtree first
-Post:  visit root of every subtree last
-In:    visit left child, root, right
